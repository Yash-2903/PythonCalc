# Python Calculator

* For this project, we need to create a calculator using Python that has automated unit tests.  

* This calculator is required to perform the following operations: 
1) Addition
2) Subtraction
3) Multiplication
4) Division
5) Square
6) Square root

* You need to correctly use static methods, object methods, object attributes/properties.  

* You need to use the included files to load data for your unit tests.  Use each file to test the associated operation.   

* You need to make at least 7 unit tests and should develop your tests as you write the program.

* Here is the CSV file we have to use to load the data [CSV files](https://github.com/Yash-2903/PythonCalc/tree/master/src/CSVFiles)

* Here we have to use Docker to run the test case for following operations.

* The grammar of programming is referred to as [SOLID](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/solid-design-principles-python-examples-hiral-amodia/?trk=public_profile_article_view) and is consistent for all object-oriented languages. 

# Requirement

* Correct usage of object and static methods and properties
* At least 7 unit tests
* At least 7 commits
* Your program works
* Your docker file is setup to run the program
 
## [Here is the Example for all Operation run in Docker!](https://github.com/Yash-2903/PythonCalc/blob/master/Example.MD)
